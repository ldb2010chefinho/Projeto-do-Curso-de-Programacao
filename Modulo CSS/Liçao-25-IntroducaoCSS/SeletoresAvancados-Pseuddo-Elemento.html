        Rap God (Eminem) <br>
        Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming I'm a human <br>
        What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman <br>
        Innovative and I'm made of rubber <br>
        So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me <br>
        And it'll glue to you <br>
        <br><br>
        And I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating <br>
        How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating <br>
        Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting <br>
        For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating <br>
        'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated <br>
        I make elevating music, you make elevator music <br>
